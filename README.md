# Capstone-Project-Shift-Code
In this challenge you will need to use the following skills: 
 input and display data; 
 lists; 
 splitting and joining strings; 
 if statements; 
 loops (while and for); 
 subprograms

## The Challenge
A shift code is where a message can be easily encoded and is one of the simplest codes to use. Each letter is moved forwards through the alphabet a set number of letters to be represented by a new letter. For instance, “abc” becomes “bcd” when the code is shifted by one (i.e. each letter in the alphabet is moved forward one character).
